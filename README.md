**Azorion** is a Solana smart contract designed to revolutionize reward distribution by enabling a dynamic task-based earning system. Users can engage in predefined activities and earn SOL rewards that fluctuate in real-time, adapting to the balance of task demand and user supply. This decentralized approach prevents farming abuse, making it ideal for a wide range of applications from play-to-earn gaming to decentralized work platforms.

</p>

At its core, Azorion establishes a demand-responsive incentive structure. Rewards are algorithmically increased during periods of high task availability and low user engagement, effectively incentivizing participation. Conversely, rewards are moderated when user activity exceeds available tasks, promoting system sustainability and preventing inflationary pressures.

To safeguard against manipulation, Azorion integrates robust anti-farming protocols and a cooldown mechanism, maintaining system integrity and equitable access for all users. User reward data is securely managed via Program Derived Addresses (PDAs), leveraging Solana's inherent security to guarantee data integrity and user privacy.

## üì¶ Deployment Instructions

To deploy Azorion to different Solana networks:

### Local Validator Deployment

1.  **Start Local Validator:**  `solana-test-validator`
2.  **Deploy Program:** `anchor deploy` (Ensure Solana CLI is set to local validator URL)

### Devnet Deployment

1.  **Set Solana Config to Devnet:** `solana config set --url devnet`
2.  **Request Devnet SOL:** `solana airdrop 5` (Request SOL for your wallet if needed)
3.  **Deploy Program:** `anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet`

### Testnet/Mainnet Deployment

*Deployment to Testnet or Mainnet requires careful consideration and thorough testing on Devnet/Testnet first. Ensure you have sufficient SOL in your wallet to cover deployment and transaction fees.*

1.  **Set Solana Config to Testnet/Mainnet:** `solana config set --url testnet` or `solana config set --url mainnet-beta`
2.  **Ensure Sufficient SOL Balance:** Fund your wallet with enough SOL for deployment and initial program operation.
3.  **Deploy Program:** `anchor deploy --provider.cluster testnet` or `anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet`
