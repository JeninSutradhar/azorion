# Azorion - A Dynamic Task-Based Reward System on Solana
Azorion is a Solana-based smart contract that enables users to complete tasks and earn SOL rewards dynamically based on demand-supply logic. This decentralized reward system ensures fair distribution, prevents farming abuse, and provides a leaderboard to track top earners.

`⚠️Under Developement`

🔹 **Key Features:**  
✅ **Task-Based Earning** – Users complete predefined activities (e.g., voting, staking, referrals) to earn SOL rewards.  
✅ **Dynamic Reward System** – Uses **demand-supply mechanics** to **increase/decrease rewards** based on availability.  
✅ **PDA-Based User Tracking** – Stores user **task history & rewards** securely on Solana using **Program Derived Addresses (PDA)**.  
✅ **Anti-Farming Protection** – Prevents users from **spamming the same task** by applying progressive reward reduction.  
✅ **Cooldown System** – Users must **wait 5 seconds** before performing another task to avoid abuse.  
✅ **RNG-Based Task Availability** – Tasks are **randomly marked as available/unavailable** every 10 seconds.  
✅ **Leaderboard (Planned Feature/Soon to be Implemented)** – Displays **top 5 earners** based on total SOL rewards and completed tasks.
